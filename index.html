		<h1>Build Your Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2> Which two websites am I most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I love the simplicity of <a href="http://www.cukeragency.com/"> Cuker Agency </a> and <a href="http://socialdriver.com/"> Social Driver </a>.</p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Both utilizes a lot of clean white space, and have a grided structure with three or four columns.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>Both have a similar style and I find myself liking simple, clean websites, that use a responsive structure with grided content in utilizing parallax scrolling.</p>
