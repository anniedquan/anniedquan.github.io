		<h1>Build Your Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2> Which two websites am I most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I love the simplicity of <a href="http://www.cukeragency.com/"> Cuker Agency </a> and <a href="http://socialdriver.com/"> Social Driver </a>.</p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Both utilizes a lot of clean white space, and have a grided structure with three or four columns.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>Both have a similar style and I find myself liking simple, clean websites, that use a responsive design with grided content in utilizing parallax scrolling.</p>
		<p>Cuker Interactive does a better job integrating their media. Rather than using embedded players and widgets, Cuker has a cleaner UI with their media player.</p>
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<h4>Wireframe for www.anniequan.com</h4>
		<p>My site is very simple with basic information and a single focal image. I would like to utilize a parallax scroll and plan on a modern flat design.</p>
